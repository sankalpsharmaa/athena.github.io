# MSE Athena Magazine

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for all Athena-related content. We have primarily created this repo to house all the code related to the upcoming edition of the MSE Athena magazine. This repo also hosts code related to the processing and analysis of the Mental Health Survey of economics postgraduates in India, conducted in March 2021.

## Mental Health Survey

Watch this space closely - we'll be making the survey data open-for-all very shortly. This initiative is in the spirit of transparency and reproducibility; we aim for as many researchers, students, policy-makers to get access to this data and use it to draw their own insights. We'll also be releasing metadata to ensure minimal ambiguity in the interpretation of variables captured in the survey.
